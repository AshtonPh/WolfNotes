## Project proposal
**1.  Project team information**
- Zelda Lu (wlu27).

- Deci Horine (djhorine).

- Pham Thanh Nam (pthanhn).

**2.  Project Title**
    

Our web-application will be called ‘Wolfnotes’.

**3.  Target users**
    

Our primary audience comprises students seeking a seamless note-taking experience during lectures while maintaining a synchronized connection between their notes and lecture slides. To cater to this need, our proposed application will empower users by enabling them to effortlessly upload their lecture slides and create corresponding notes linked to specific slides.

**4. General features**

a.  Write along Slides: When creating a new set of notes, the user is given the option to upload a copy of the lecture slides. The user’s notes are segmented by what slide they were on while writing them. Moving through the slides moves through the accompanying sections of notes and vice versa. Accepted file types include: *.pptx, *.pdf
    
b.  Class Glossary: The user can add words with definitions through the notes. When you hover over these words throughout the notes, it would show you the definition of the words and the usage of the words. As well as if these terms have been used in your other lecture notes, so the user can have a better understanding of the terms and create a stronger connection between different sections of the knowledge.
    
c.  Shorthand Expansion: When enabled, shorthand phrases such as “w/” (‘with’) and “w/o” (‘without’) will automatically expand to their longer variants. The application will have both a built-in set of shorthands and a user-defined list of shorthands.
    
d.  Offline capability: It provides online and offline features, the users can edit, create and view local notes offline.The users would be able to back up their notes online to avoid any risk of local data corruption, as well as the ability to look up their notes offline on the local machine when the users work in a non-internet connection space.
    

e. Notes and Slides Synchronization: Sync sections of the notes to targeted lecture slides. As a user, they can scroll through the notes and pick the note they need on one side of the screen, and the lecture notes that the user takes notes on would appear on the other side of the screen. This would provide users easy access to their notes and the connected lecture slides.

**5. Data required**

- The lecture slides that the users would acquire from their classes. 
- Definitions of terms from user’s lecture slides and textbooks. 
- Basic user credentials would be required. At the time of writing this proposal, these include: 
	- User’s email address. 
	- User’s name. 
	- User’s password. 
	- Agreement to terms and conditions. 
	- User’s institution (optional). 
	- Current courses (optional). 
	- Profile picture (optional). 
The user will be asked to provide this information upon creating their account.

 **6. Draft wireframes**
